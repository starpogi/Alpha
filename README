Developed on Texas Instruments MSP430 G2331 Microcontroller using 32 KHz
standard clock oscillator. Implemented on ID-20 Innovations 125 kHz RFID Reader
and GDM1620K 16x2 LCD Screen.

The algorithm used to detect presence using Wiegand protocol will be
used in the future Smart House Control projects, particularly Blackstorm.
A watchdog timer ticks at about 100 microseconds to take in every byte
from the RFID reader via asynchronous interrupts. This standard has
nuances on data transmission. The last nth and (n-1)th bytes are usually
corrupted, possible due to wiring problems or timing difficulties. This
will be addressed by Project Blackstorm as it aims to develop robust
simple interoperable platforms for streaming information to other Smart
House Control modules.
